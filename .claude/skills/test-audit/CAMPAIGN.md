# Test-pruning campaign

Campaign mode prunes one subsystem's whole test surface in one coherent
change set: `src/worker/`, `extensions/`, `control-panel/`, or one `src/lib`
area such as billing or library-processing. The value bar, retention bar,
candidate evidence, and validation in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) apply to every
lane. This file adds the order of work and the lessons of a full campaign
(first run upstream in OpenClaw on its Telegram plugin). Each step ends on its
completion criterion; do not start the next step early.

Run a campaign on a branch (`git switch -c test-campaign/<subsystem>`) — it is
the one case where working off `main` is the default, since it spans many
commits. Keep the ledger and plans in `docs/tmp/test-campaign-<subsystem>/`.

## 1. Baseline

Record the subsystem's test and support line counts and every test file's
pass/fail state at a pinned `main` SHA, with local Supabase running so
integration files execute instead of self-skipping. Record skipped files as
skipped, not passed. Keep baseline failures in their own list: upstream, all
three baseline failures were real delivery bugs, not stale tests.

Done when every in-scope test file has a recorded baseline result.

## 2. Lanes and inventory

Split the surface into **lanes** along production owner boundaries, not file
prefixes. For `src/worker/` that might be job claim/lease, execute, poll
loops, sweep, account-events gateway, and health/lifecycle; for `extensions/`,
background, content, popup, and the shared message protocol. Include the
subsystem's cases at shared boundaries (e.g. the `src/lib` job helpers the
worker calls, the app-side `src/lib/extension/` transport) and its live
suites (`test:live`, `test:e2e`, `extensions` `test:live`).

Done when every test file and live scenario the subsystem owns belongs to
exactly one lane.

## 3. Read-only ledger per lane

Give each lane to its own read-only agent. The agent reads every assigned test
in full, including parameter tables. It also reads the production owners and
their entry points, callers, history, and CI routing. Each test declaration
goes into a written **ledger** with one mark. An `it.each` is one declaration
unless its rows need different marks; then mark each row.

- `R`: retain, naming the contract and the bug it catches; a retained test that
  only moves to a better-named file stays `R` with the move noted;
- `F`: retain the contract but repair the assertion, such as a vacuous negative
  that passes when only one of several items is missing;
- `C`: consolidate, naming the owner that absorbs the assertion first: a sibling
  table case, a stronger boundary suite, or the shared owner in `src/lib`;
- `D`: delete, naming the proof that remains, or why no contract exists.

Judge a test by its assertions, not its name. Upstream, a test named for
retiring a progress window asserted the window was _not_ cleared.

Done when every declaration in the lane has a mark and an evidence line.

## 4. Layer plan per lane

Treat the per-test ledger as input, not as the edit list. A second read-only
pass, starting from the ledger, looks for the redundant **layer** — typically
several suites replaying the same shared helper through one mocked
collaborator, around a stronger suite that exercises the real boundary. Name
the **keeper** suite for each contract. Prefer the real boundary with a fake
edge (real local Postgres over a mocked Supabase client; a fake `fetch` over a
mocked service module) to a mocked collaborator. Correct any ledger errors
this pass finds.

Done when each lane plan names its retired files, its keeper per contract, the
assertions to carry into keepers, and the test-only production seams unlocked.

## 5. Cutover

Edit lane by lane. Serialize changes to shared test support (`src/test/*`,
`vite.config.ts`) through one owner. With each lane, remove the test-only
production seams it unlocks: injection parameters, getters, reset exports, and
indirection layers. Update `domTestFiles` and `liveTestExcludes` for moved or
deleted suites. If the campaign surfaced a durable test-ownership rule, add it
to the Testing section of the root `CLAUDE.md` — only rules drawn from
mistakes this campaign actually found.

Done when every lane plan is applied and each lane's keepers pass.

## 6. Preservation review

Before claiming completion, have independent reviewers compare deleted
coverage against the keepers, one reviewer per boundary group. They look for
contracts that lost their only proof. They also look for new assertions that
cannot fail, such as a rejection row the production code never reaches.
Upstream, this review found nine real gaps and one unreachable assertion.

For each restored contract, make one deliberate **mutation** of the production
owner and confirm the keeper goes red. Then restore the source byte for byte
(`git diff` on the owner must be empty afterwards).

Done when every reported gap is restored or rejected with source evidence, and
every restored contract has a caught mutation.

## 7. Product defects

A baseline failure that survives into a keeper is a bug report. Fix it at its
owner as a separate commit, and prove it through the real user flow (the dev
stack via `bun run dev:all`, or the owning integration/live suite), with a
**control** run that reverts the fix and shows the old behavior. Record
unrelated product discrepancies as follow-ups instead of fixing them in the
campaign.

Done when each repaired defect has a failing control and a passing candidate
on the same harness.

## 8. Reconcile and hand off

Campaigns outlive many `main` commits. Merge `main` rather than rebasing a
long, many-commit campaign. When `main` modified a file the campaign deleted,
keep the deletion. Port the new contract into the keeper instead, and confirm
every new regression `main` added still has a home. Rerun the whole subsystem
suite (with local Supabase up) and repeat live proof on the merged head.

Hand off with the [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) report, plus:

- baseline and final test/support line counts, with production counted separately;
- lanes, retired layers, and keepers;
- preservation gaps found and their mutations;
- product defects with control and candidate proof.
